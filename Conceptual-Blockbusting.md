## Introduction

* **Confirmation bias** - The act of seeking evidence which confirm existing beliefs. If evidence is encountered which contradicts our current beliefs, then we tend to discount the evidence.

## Chapter 1
* The brain is highly efficient. It must juggle a lot of tasks to keep the body running.
* It will want to forget/ignore things if it can't keep up.
* _Creative work_ requires slow, iterative processes. It contradicts the demands of having quick responses.
* Conceptual blocks stop us from finding creative solutions
* We spend little time monitoring our own thinking, and too much of it comparing it with a more sophisticated ideal.
* System 1 and System 2 thinking from "Thinking Fast and Slow". 
* **System 1** involves thinking fast, making quick decisions which come natural to us.
* **System 2** is more involved, it is slower. We use it when we need to make bigger decisions which tend to utilize more creativity.
* **Example** Monk going up a mountain on a narrow path problem. When going down, prove that the Monk was on some point of the path at the same time of day as going up.
  * Actually hard to solve this problem just thinking about it verbally.
  * Easier to solve if just plotting the lines of both instances through a time<>position chart. Intersection of lines will indicate the solution.
* **Satisficing** - It is the act of quickly making a decision which is sufficient, and not really looking for more.
  * Example: Finding a needle in the haystack, but not continuing on to find the sharpest needle (if there is more. There could be more... but you don't know because you stopped!)
* Habitual thinking is natural and our tendency to use when we are forced to make quick decision and answer. (System 1)
* Conceptualization is the key to problem solving.

## Chapter 2 - Perceptual Blocks
* **Perceptual blocks** - Obstacles that prevent the problem solver from clearly perceiving the problem itself, or the information needed to solve the problem.
* Stereotypes give us a lot of preconceptions which inhibit our ability to overcome perceptual blocks.
* Stereotyping simplifies the brain's work.
* STM vs LTM, or "short-term memory" vs "long-term memory" - LTM has 2 types:
  * Explicit - Where we take more time to remember something. For example, a speech.
  * Implicit - Where we recall things unconciously. For example, driving a car.
* The things in STM eventually make their way to LTM if we act on trying to remember it for the long-term immediately. (Writing things down, repeatedly stating it, etc)
* But the easiest thing to ensure things make it to LTM is to remember things by gaining context in what we are trying to remember.
* We convince ourselves further to stereotypes and confirm our biases. That is, when faced with hard problems, we fallback to what we currently know, and sometimes that involves our stereotyped view on things.
* We tend to try to solve problems based on our expertise. This leads to trying to solve the problem in the wrong way, or event attempting to solve the problem by only alleviating symptoms.
* Restating the problem in alternate ways or reframing it with less restrictions may help with solving it. Even trying to solve the opposite problem helps. 
* When faced with a hard problem, one should not give too many constraints.
* We tend to get blocked solving problems because we try too hard to stay within some _artificial constraint_.

## Chapter 3 - Emotional Blocks
* Conceptualization is _risky_ and new ideas are hard to evaluate. The expression of a new idea, and effort to convince someone can make you feel embarassed because it can expose imperfections of your idea, or yourself.
* Humans and animals have a fight or flight response. The difference between humans and zebras, for example, is what happens after the fight or flight response.
  * Zebras immediately go back to grazing after fleeing.
  * Humans continue to think about the danger that just occured.
* The feeling of failure from the risk in trying a new idea can sometimes inhibit it from actually letting the person take action.
* Internal conflicts within oneself can prevent new ideas from developing.
* There are 3 internal forces which can conflict when a new idea crops up in your mind:
  1. id - it is concerned with our needs (ideas)
  2. ego - may reject ideas due to fear in not following through
  3. superego - may reject ideas because it feels we should not have them in the first place
* If ego and superego accept the idea, then it will go to the conscious mind, potentially unlocking new creativity.
* Emotional blocks interfere with our ability to explore new ideas:
  1. Fear of making a mistake, failing, or taking risk.
  2. Inability to tolerate ambiguity and chaotic environment. We want to be able to maintain security and order.
  3. We prefer to judge ideas rather than generate them. (Easier to be opinionated)
  4. We may have to inability to relax, and let the idea incubate (sleep on it) and instead rush to act.
  5. The idea fails to engage interest or allows motivation to succeed.
  6. Inability to distinguish reality from fantasy.
* Risk - Sometimes we overthink about the risk involved with an idea. We need to do proper assessment about what can _actually_ go wrong before we give up on an idea. It may be that the work which could happen can be mitigated.
  * Tip - Write a report on what the worst could happen if we are to act on an idea which we have.
* We have _no tolerance for chaos_. We limit ourselves to structure and order because of potentially being uncomfortable and out of routine.
* Judging rather than generating ideas is easier to do.
* We don't let ourselves have enough time to allow for incubation or "letting the problem sink in" while in search for the best solution. Sometimes the best solution to a problem appears after much time being away from it.
* Incubation allows for your brain to internalize all the information that was found during the experimentation process.
* If we aren't motivated to solve the problem, then there is very little chance for success. We will have many emotional blocks due to the lack of motivation.
* Being able to distinguish rality and fantasy within the scope of the problem is important. To be a creative problem solver, we must be able to open up and imagine things that can be out of the norm and make us feel uncomfortable.
* Flow - Rhythm in solving a problem is important.

## Chapter 4 - Cultural and Environmental Blocks
* Cultural taboos, can remove entire families of solutions from the problem solver.
* Taboos are conceptual blocks
* Our culture tends to train away mental playfulness, fantasy, and reflectiveness out of people by putting more value on real mental activities (logic, solving a problem, etc)
* Left vs. Right brain thinking is an outdated way of thinking about how the brain works.
* Humans can be a bit tribal by associating ourselves with others who have similar opinions.
* Small groups with interest in creativity can do better than much larger, but less cohesive groups.
* To make things or processes better, you must be convinced that change is needed in a particular area, or else it is not likely that you can hypothesize ways in accomplishing change.
* Another environmental block is having a great idea, but not enough resources to bring it to fruition.
