## Introduction

* **Confirmation bias** - The act of seeking evidence which confirm existing beliefs. If evidence is encountered which contradicts our current beliefs, then we tend to discount the evidence.

## Chapter 1
* The brain is highly efficient. It must juggle a lot of tasks to keep the body running.
* It will want to forget/ignore things if it can't keep up.
* _Creative work_ requires slow, iterative processes. It contradicts the demands of having quick responses.
* Conceptual blocks stop us from finding creative solutions
* We spend little time monitoring our own thinking, and too much of it comparing it with a more sophisticated ideal.
* System 1 and System 2 thinking from "Thinking Fast and Slow". 
* **System 1** involves thinking fast, making quick decisions which come natural to us.
* **System 2** is more involved, it is slower. We use it when we need to make bigger decisions which tend to utilize more creativity.
* **Example** Monk going up a mountain on a narrow path problem. When going down, prove that the Monk was on some point of the path at the same time of day as going up.
  * Actually hard to solve this problem just thinking about it verbally.
  * Easier to solve if just plotting the lines of both instances through a time<>position chart. Intersection of lines will indicate the solution.
* **Satisficing** - It is the act of quickly making a decision which is sufficient, and not really looking for more.
  * Example: Finding a needle in the haystack, but not continuing on to find the sharpest needle (if there is more. There could be more... but you don't know because you stopped!)
* Habitual thinking is natural and our tendency to use when we are forced to make quick decision and answer. (System 1)
* Conceptualization is the key to problem solving.
