# Don't Make Me Think

Steve Krug

* The main rule of thumb: Don't make us think.
* Things that make us think: cute/clever names, marketing-induced names, unfamiliar technical names, using non-standard names for things... ex: "Jobs" vs "Jobs-o-Rama".
* Eliminate "question mark" thoughts. Minimize the amount of times the user, or reader has to think about what something means, or does.
* The goal is to _MINIMIZE_ the "question mark" thoughts, and not eliminate them entirely. That's impossible. Strive to be *self-explanatory*.
* We don't _read_ web pages. We scan them for interesting content.
* When we visit a web page, the chances are that we already know what we are trying to look for. Therefore, users visit for a _purpose_.
* We are really good at scanning quickly for information.
* When we visit a page, we inherently know we don't need to read _everything_
* Our eyes focus on words that relate to the task at hand.
* We generally don't figure out how things work. We muddle through to the point where we can get the task done. Sometimes just knowing enough to get things done is _good enough_.

## Billboard Design 101

The general rules:
* Take advantage of conventions
* Create visual hierarchies
* Break pages up into clearly defined areas
* Make it **obvious** in what is _clickable_.
* Eliminate visual noise.
* Format content to support scanning

### Conventions
Use commonly used conventions. The book has a good example of a STOP sign. The shape and color of the STOP sign is consistent globally.

In the past 20 years, web design has establishe some conventions in terms of: where things are expected to be located in page, how things work, and how they look.

* Where things are expected to be located: company logo is top left, navigation is either top or side of the page. Content is in the middle, etc.

* How things work: Standardized web forms asking for payment, etc.

* How things look: Icons telling what some input is used for. For example, magnifying glass used as "search", or different colored text as a hyperlink.

Problem is that designers don't often take advantage of conventions because they are pressured to create something new. This is a form of reinventing the wheel.

**PREFER TO HAVE CLARITY**. If a choice between _clarify_ vs _consistency_, then choose _CLARITY_.

### Effective Visual Hierarchies

* Important things should be prominent. Example: Big heading for something that is very important.
* Things that are related logically will have the same, consistet visual look. For example, a group of links indicating page navigation.
* Things are nested are categorized.

Good visual hierarchies create something that is predictable, and allows support for fast scanning.

Break pages up into clearly defined areas.

Make it obvious what is clickable. Use text that is a different color to signify that it is clickable (a hyperlink).

### Keep Noise Down

Avoid disorganization and clutter on the page. Show what is important, and avoid showing what is unnecessary.

### Format Text to Support Scanning

* Prefer to use lots of headings. Group related text with heading close to each other to avoid ambiguity.
* Keep paragraphs short
* Use lots of bulleted lists.
* Highlight key terms.
