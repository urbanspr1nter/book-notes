# Don't Make Me Think

Steve Krug

* The main rule of thumb: Don't make us think.
* Things that make us think: cute/clever names, marketing-induced names, unfamiliar technical names, using non-standard names for things... ex: "Jobs" vs "Jobs-o-Rama".
* Eliminate "question mark" thoughts. Minimize the amount of times the user, or reader has to think about what something means, or does.
* The goal is to _MINIMIZE_ the "question mark" thoughts, and not eliminate them entirely. That's impossible. Strive to be *self-explanatory*.
* We don't _read_ web pages. We scan them for interesting content.
* When we visit a web page, the chances are that we already know what we are trying to look for. Therefore, users visit for a _purpose_.
* We are really good at scanning quickly for information.
* When we visit a page, we inherently know we don't need to read _everything_
* Our eyes focus on words that relate to the task at hand.
* We generally don't figure out how things work. We muddle through to the point where we can get the task done. Sometimes just knowing enough to get things done is _good enough_.

## Billboard Design 101

The general rules:
* Take advantage of conventions
* Create visual hierarchies
* Break pages up into clearly defined areas
* Make it **obvious** in what is _clickable_.
* Eliminate visual noise.
* Format content to support scanning

### Conventions
Use commonly used conventions. The book has a good example of a STOP sign. The shape and color of the STOP sign is consistent globally.

In the past 20 years, web design has establishe some conventions in terms of: where things are expected to be located in page, how things work, and how they look.

* Where things are expected to be located: company logo is top left, navigation is either top or side of the page. Content is in the middle, etc.

* How things work: Standardized web forms asking for payment, etc.

* How things look: Icons telling what some input is used for. For example, magnifying glass used as "search", or different colored text as a hyperlink.

Problem is that designers don't often take advantage of conventions because they are pressured to create something new. This is a form of reinventing the wheel.

**PREFER TO HAVE CLARITY**. If a choice between _clarify_ vs _consistency_, then choose _CLARITY_.

### Effective Visual Hierarchies

* Important things should be prominent. Example: Big heading for something that is very important.
* Things that are related logically will have the same, consistet visual look. For example, a group of links indicating page navigation.
* Things are nested are categorized.

Good visual hierarchies create something that is predictable, and allows support for fast scanning.

Break pages up into clearly defined areas.

Make it obvious what is clickable. Use text that is a different color to signify that it is clickable (a hyperlink).

### Keep Noise Down

Avoid disorganization and clutter on the page. Show what is important, and avoid showing what is unnecessary.

### Format Text to Support Scanning

* Prefer to use lots of headings. Group related text with heading close to each other to avoid ambiguity.
* Keep paragraphs short
* Use lots of bulleted lists.
* Highlight key terms.


### Mindless Choices

* Users generally don't mind the number of clicks as long as each click is painless and have _continued confidence_ that they are on the right track.
* Pages which attempt to provide guidance in getting some flow done should really:
  1. Be brief. Give the smallest amount of information that will help.
  2. Present information at points when they are exactly needed.
  3. Unavoidable content should be placed where it is _**guaranteed**_ to be noticed.


### Omit Needless Words
* Omit needless words. Getting rid of unnecessary words reduces the noise level of the page, and makes _useful_ content more prominent.
* It makes pages shorter, allowing users to see more of each page at a glance without scrolling.
* Avoid very long introductory **happy text**. Happy text is unnecessary introductions and instructions that are written as if it was promotional material. Seriously. Read it in your head and you will just hear "blah blah blah".
* Eliminate instructions and make things as straightforward as possible.

### Designing Navigation
* When we enter a website, we're in the process in trying to find something. We have a mission.
* We can either decide to ask (search) or browse the site first.
* There are 2 different types of users: search-dominate and browse-dominant users.
* Search-dominant users will almost always look for the search box first, and utilize it to navigate around the website.
* Browse-dominant, or "link-dominant" users will choose to attempt to make their way through a hierarchy to find the content that they need.
* If navigation is too difficult, chances are, the users will just leave.
* Web navigate **must** be good.
* A good starting point is to just put navigation in standard places. Similar to how we find street signs in corners, there are plenty of websites to refer to that have pretty much the same navigational patterns.
* It can be frustrating when these types of conventions are broken.
* When browsing from page to page, the users expect that navigational elements across these pages should stay the same. The location is static, and it is good confirmation to the user that they are still in the same site.
* Site ID, or logo, or link to the hom page should appear as frequently as possible to assure the user they are still on the same site. This is usually in the form of a logo at the top of the page which provides a link to the homepage.
* The main navigation of the site should include 2 main components:
  1. The sections - possible places users can navigate to.
  2. The utilitiese - Things such as support section, search box, etc.
* Again, in all pages, provide a mechanism to allow the user to go back to the home page. This is usually in the form of the logo, or "Home" button. The Home navigation acts as a "north star" for the user. If they get lost, they can navigate to Home and start over.
* **Big MISTAKE** - Have lots of levels (4+) of navigation should mean that you must give the same attention of detail as the top level navigation. In some sites, the lower levels of navigation often lack the same polished usability as higher levels.
* If a page can be navigated to, it should have a name, and it must be in the "right place". The name of the page *should* match what the user has clicked.
* Make use of "active" styling to help reassure where the user is in the site. This is usually done by providing different styling on the links relating to the active page. Also, boldface on the corresponding breadcrumb element.
* It is nice to think useres go to your site starting from the home page and then navigating from place to place. However, the reality is that users are usually placed at some random page from some referrer such as a search engine, or social media site without much knowledge, or idea where they are exactly. 
  * The usability design of the site must be prepared for this type of scenario. The user must have their sense of direction when being placed on the page.
* Refer to the "trunk test" to see if your site is clear enough to navigate around with.

### The Importance in Getting People Off the Right Foot
* The home page is very complex. Lots of content has to be packed into a single page. Introduction, site hierarchy, search, promotions, timely content, deals, shortcuts, registration, etc. 
* The home page also at the same time, has to be intuitive to use, and informative in letting the user know where to begin.
* The home page also has to make the user feel secure be trustworthy.
* That's a lot of responsibility for the home page. It is very challenging. 
* Designing a home page for a company is very challenging in that we're always trying to "squeeze one more thing".
* Despite all these features, often times, the home page fails to communicate the big picture. Designs for home page lack the ability to make it clear enough _what the site is_. 
* Home page has to be able to answer 4 questions immediately:
  1. What is this?
  2. What can I do here?
  3. What do they have here?
  4. Why should I be here and not somewhere else?
* The user must be able to answer these questions at a glance with very little effort.
* The first few seconds anyone spends on a website is very critical.
* If users are already lost just getting started, then as they progress, they just keep getting even _more lost_.
* It is critical to get users off the right food. You need to make sure that they are clear on the big picture.
* Use as much space as needed to explain the site, but don't use any more space than necessary. Remember, omit needless words. Don't feel compelled to mention every great feature. Just the important ones.
* Don't use your company's mission statement as a Welcome blurb. Nobody reads mission statements. The Welcome blurb should be a quick summary on what the site is.
* Don't try to promote everything on the home page. 

### Why Most Arguments About Usability are a Waste of Time, and How to Avoid Them
* Most teams end up spending lots of time rehashing the same issues over and over again. Avoid religious debates, they not only waste time, but create unnecessary tension, and respect deteriorates amongst team members.
* We tend to think most users are like "us". So then we form opinions for them. When endorphins are at work, it's hard to imagine that everybody doesn't feel the same way.
* Result is that designers want to build sites that look great, developers want to build sites with interesting, original, ingenious features.
* Differences in perspective often lead to conflict.
* Myth of the average user. There is no average user. Don't assume the "average user" likes X and dislikes Y (vice versa). There are no simple "right" answers for web design. Obviously there are some things you should never do, and some things that can be done under extraordinary circumstances, but these things are not the fuel for the religious debates.
* It's not productive to ask "Do most people like pull-down menus?" The best way to ask the question is to ask: "Does _this_ pull-down with _these_ items and _this_ wording in _this_ context on _this_ page create a good experience for most people who are _likely_ to use _this_ site?" -- Really only 1 way to answer this: **testing**.
* Perform usability testing. You will see what works, and doesn't work for users.

### Keeping Testing Simple - So You Do Enough of It
* Focus group vs usability testing. Focus groups should be done _before_ you begin designing or building anything. Usability testing should be done through the entire process.
* Small regular rounds of testing can be helpful. It is predictable, and cheap. And just one session can uncover a lot of things.
* Test participants don't necessarily have to be part of the target audience. It can be almost anybody. In the beginning, you can find a lot of issues with your site with just normal people. Target audience recruitment can be unnecessarily expensive in time and money. It's still important to find users of your target audience, but it isn't as important as it seems. 
* Perform the test remotely if getting a room is hard. Screensharing software works. Just make sure to record the session.
* The person to facilitate the test should be patient, calm, empathetic and a good listener. It is also their job to help the participates "think aloud" as much as possible.

### Mobile
* Designing for mobile usability can be challenging. More constraints in screen size is the biggest factor.
* Mobile versions of web sites sometimes try to pack too much information in. This leads to a very difficult to read site, or a slow performing site on mobile.
* Most challenges in creating good mobile usability boil down to making good tradeoffs.
* Don't assume that people who visit mobile versions of web pages only want to do a subset of functions that the full desktop version can. For most people, mobile devices are their first (and possibly only) computing device.
* Always give users the option to browse the non-mobile version of the website. As long as there is zooming capabilities buil-in, some people actually prefer use the version they are more familiar with, in this case, it could be the desktop version of the site.
* Do not sacrifice affordances. Buttons should look like buttons! They should look clickable! Input boxes should have borders! 
* Don't depend on a hover state. There are no cursors on mobile devices. 
* Flat design... this takes away affordances. Flat design makes it harder to differentiate things. If you choose to go with flat design, make sure you compensate for the lost of affordances.
* 

### Your Website Should be a Human Being
* When users land on your website, they start with a "reservoir of goodwill". Every problem they encounter on the site will lower the level of that reservoir. 
* If this reservoir is depleted, then there's a good chance they'll leave. Even worse, they will just stop using the site in the future, and give bad reviewes. 
* However, sometimes it can be refilled, or it can be depleted immediately. It is situational.
* Things that diminish goodwill:
  1. Hiding information users want. Customer support numbers, shipping rates, prices, etc.
  2. Punishing users for not doing things your way. Don't insist on making users jump through hoops just because you don't want to write a little bit of code to accommodate. 
  3. Asking for information you don't really need. It is annoying.
  4. Don't patronize. 
  5. Useless marketing.
  6. Site looks unprofessional.
* Things that increase goodwill:
  1. Know the main things that people want to do on your site and make it obvious an deasy.
  2. Tell users what they want to know. (Shipping costs, fees, support numbers, etc.)
  3. Cutting to the chase.
  4. Putting effort into things (support websites - provide lots of materials)
  5. Try to predict the questions the users may have.
  6. Printer friendly pages!
  7. Make it easy to recover from errors.
  8. When in doubt provide messaging that is apologetic.

### Accessibility
* The site isn't usable until it is accessible.
* There are more users who have some sort of challenge than you would assume.
* It is profoundly the right thing to do.
* Don't skimp on accessibility just because:
  1. It is more work.
  2. It compromises "pretty" design.
* Here's how to start to make your site more accessible:
  1. Fix the usability problems that already confuse _EVERYONE_.
  2. Read an article or ask users who use screen reading software how it is actually use.
  3. Books
  4. Go for low hanging fruit. Make sure your cross your ts and dot your is. Add appropriate elements relating to accessibility on the site. (alt text, headings, form compatibility with screen reader, keyboard shortcuts, etc.)
  5. Use accessible template.
