# Don't Make Me Think

Steve Krug

* The main rule of thumb: Don't make us think.
* Things that make us think: cute/clever names, marketing-induced names, unfamiliar technical names, using non-standard names for things... ex: "Jobs" vs "Jobs-o-Rama".
* Eliminate "question mark" thoughts. Minimize the amount of times the user, or reader has to think about what something means, or does.
* The goal is to _MINIMIZE_ the "question mark" thoughts, and not eliminate them entirely. That's impossible. Strive to be *self-explanatory*.
* We don't _read_ web pages. We scan them for interesting content.
* When we visit a web page, the chances are that we already know what we are trying to look for. Therefore, users visit for a _purpose_.
