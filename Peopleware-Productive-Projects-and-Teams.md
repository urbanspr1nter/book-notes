## Chapter 1
* It's easier to manage tchonlogy than people.
* New managers were taught how to do their job, and not _manage_ it.

## Chapter 2
* Managing a sfotware team is not like managing a fast food restaurant.
* Humans are individuals and have different needs. They should not be treated as just parts of a machine.
* A person is an individual and they fit into the project as a whole with their own abilities and special skills.

## Chapter 3
* **Spanish Theory** - A fixed amount of value exists on earth, and in order to gain wealth, it must be learned how to extract it more efficiently off the sources.
* **English Theory** - It is possible to create value through ingenuity. 
* The Spanish Theory in management is to get people to work harder and more.
* It is not a great idea to extract the effort and energy of works (through overtime, for example) until they are burnt out and nothing is left!
* Overtime forces people to take away from their life to meet some arbitrary deadline.
* The Spnaish Theory may seem productive at first, but ultimately will **not** be. 

## Chapter 4
* Quality should not be dictated by what the market finds acceptable. The market has been trained to accept low-quality software. As long as the software gets the job done for them, it is fine. The builder (software developer) may disagree.
* The builder will usually want to strive for quality (naturally), but will not have time in the project to do so.
* There should be enough time in a project to allow for more quality.
* If quality goes up, then so does productivity.

## Chapter 5
* **Parkinson's Law** - If you end up with extra time in a work day, or project, there will be some force which exists to make busy work to fill up that day.
* Really tight project deadlines really destroy productivity.
* People don't like working in a no-win situation or environment. (Project running late? Then work overtime. Project running on time? Then pull the deadline up and work overtime!)
* Remove bias in a project timeline estimation. Reasonable timelines lead to more productivity.

## Chapter 6
* The manager's function is not to make people work, but to make it _possible_ for people to work. 
* Don't believe in various hype ideas which can suddenly help you improve as a manager with respect to the team's productivity without any real data or evidence.
* People never work well under a lot of pressure. So avoid creating an environment which enables this.

## Chapter 7
* Make the office space enjoyable to be in. People will want to work in healthy physical environments.

## Chapter 8
* People shouldn't need to work at odd times just to be able to work in a quiet environment with little interruptions.
* It's found that the most productive workers through Coding War games were those who worked well with others in their company.
* Correlated to having a good office environment.
* Open office can be distracting.

## Chapter 9
* It is not worth trying to save money on squeezing out more office space. Money is then lost due to productivity loss of the developer!
* It leads to lower product quality.
* Workers who are able to tune out noise in an open environment are just as productive as workers who have dedicated space.
* However, workers who have opinions about noise level are the ones who suffer productivity loss.
* Don't make workers search for alternative spaces in the office to get quiet time just to work effectively!

## Chapter 10
* Prioritizing an office space which is quiet promotes flow time.

## Chapter 11
* Telephone - BAD.
* Email - GOOD.

## Chapter 12
* People don't care about having elaborate or expensive working space.
* Personal space matters most!
* As long as the working space isn't obviously depressing or dangerous, it can be fine.

## Chapter 13
* Buildings should be able to evolve to the needs of the occupant.
* It should be extensible and adhere to design patterns which lead to a good environment.

## Chapter 14
* Leaders/managers should have best effort to push their reports to be better.
* Work with what you have, but best to just not create a team with those who are not fit for th job to begin with.

## Chapter 15
* Organizations should let leaders grow naturally. As a manager, the individuals under you will also become leaders in their area.
* We are adults. There is no need to produce so much hot air talking about leadership, etc.

## Chapter 16
* Should interview someone and have them demonstrate some of their skill before hiring them.
* A portfolio of their recent work is good.
* An "audition interview" is also good. It allows for members of your team to have conversations/solve problems with the candidate.
* Be careful about talking about obscure topics which don't relate to the job. It could allow the candidate to be passionate about something and seem energetic, but they may never show this again when the real job needs to be done.

## Chapter 17
* Gone are the days in which software teams are primarly composed of men.
* It is for the better that teams are more diverse now. Women and those from other cultures, or with disabilities allow for different perspectives and also just better environment.
* Important to just not overhire. Let team jell naturally. Too many coming in without enough jell time can break dynamic.

## Chapter 18
* Make sure younger hires aren't convinced that they somehow work beter under continuous "partial attention" mode.
* Ex: Spending 2% of work day on Facebook vs. spending 2% of attention constantly on Facebook.
* It is difficult to get into "flow" state when not focused on the task.
* As a manager, be very clear about the expectations and "contract" with the hire.

## Chapter 19
* Most people don't really know the real turnover rate of their company.
* Why people leave: The worker may naturally feel like they are not meant for long-term involvement in the job. Or, managers have instilled a culture of workers as disposable which leads to workers thinking they are just interchangeable parts. It can cause people to think there is no sense of loyalty with this mindset.
* Managers with a lot of ego and insecure promot huge company moves that affect the personal lives of the workers. 
* This is not the 1960s anymore. Workers have spouses who also work. They also have a personal life. 

## Chapter 20
* Human capital can be an expense, or an asset.
* A new hire may be costly at first due to ramp-up time. However, will turn into asset due to knowledge.
* Good to invest in employees and help them become assets. Ramp-up time again, is expensive.

## Chapter 21
* A jelled team is a group of people who are very close to each other. 
* It results in that the WHOLE is greater than sum of the parts.
* A jelled team is VERY, VERY productive. The probabililty of their success is very high on a project.
* Mistake that teams should work on reaching a goal. Really, the best way to think about it is to actually have the team be _aligned_ towards a goal. Programming tends to be individualistic, so as long as the team understands what they are trying to reach, it is good.
* Signs of a jelled team: low turnover, strong sense of idenity, and joint ownership of a product
* **The purpose of a team is not goal attainment but goal alignment**. 

## Chapter 22
* Discussion on the Black Team

## Chapter 23
* There are things that can counter a jelled team. We call this "Teamicide".
* **Defensive Management** - If the manager doesn't trust his own people, and start acting in micro-managing ways, then that's something that can result in Teamicide.
* **Bureaucracy** - Too much paperwork and permission involved with everything.
* **Physical Separation** - Allow the team to actually be close together physically in the office. Putting them in different floors or buildings is not productive.
* **Fragmentation of Time**  - Don't make your team members move from one task to another without letting them focus and get into flow for their project. This will create unproductive team which will result in poor execution in projects. 
* **Quality-Reduced Project** - Canceling projects or deprioritizing kills morale.
* **Phony Deadlines** - Don't cause overtime.
* **Clique Control** - Management breaking up jelled teams because they feel it is a threat and a "clique"

## Chapter 24
* Pointless motivational posters and corporate feel-good stuff.

> See attached audio asset for the audio version of this chapter. This is one of my favorites, so I've decided to read it out. 

## Chapter 25
* Internal competition may be counter-productive.
* Things such as annual salary and merit reviews, excess praise to only a select workers, awards and prizes tied to performance can have a negative impact on the team. Those who aware of such policies may start competing internally with their own colleagues.
* No matter how much a team member may seem to be OK with that sort of competition, a long string of losses, may shift their emotional mindset. 

## Chapter 26
* Good managers let their team figure out how to solve a problem on their own without much intervention.

## Chapter 27
* Good managers surround themselves with the best people. These best people will look out for the interests of managers.
* In return, the manager will protect the worker and make sure they are as productive as possible.

## Chapter 28
* Let the team grow naturally, and don't break them up when a project is over. They have momentum.
* Allow that momentum to continue in a project. It will result in a lot of productivity.

## Chapter 29
* Automation of things that usually are non-deterministic is bound to break.
* One huge corner case is the ability to "UNDO" an action. So be mindful.
* Too much methodologies can become annoying. It results in lots of paperwork, questions of who is actually responsible for something, and a general loss of motivation.

## Chapter 30
* The one risk we tend to not manager is our own failure.
* Managing risks is basically to consider how to MITIGATE failure, not prevent it.
* Afterall, failure is OK once in a while. It allows for us to learn and grow. So it should be expected.

## Chapter 31
* Meetings suck. Too many of it is bad. 
* Stand-up meetings, ceremonies, etc. 
* Some meetings are just better off being a one on one conversation. Really, does everyone else need to hear your conversation of Bob? 

## Chapter 32
* Overstaffing

## Chapter 33
* Don't overly use email.
* It can add so much time to curate through email. 
* What does FYI even mean? Most of the time, one does not need to know about this information.
* Maybe some reasons:
  * CC and sending it can make it look like someone is working
  * If something happens, that person can be accountable for not informing the other person who was supposed to take action
  * An "open organization"
  * A person wants to show how great of a writer they are.
* Reduce the corporate spam!

## Chapter 34
* Change is also followed by CHAOS. Chaos will then lead to order, when the organization has acclimated.
* How to invoke change? Through convincing.
* Two enemies to change in an org: those who are blindly loyal, and those who militantly oppose the change. 
* Blindly loyal will not be constructive. Militantly opposed will be closed-minded.
* The best are the ones who will need convincing through data and evidence, and will question the approach."Show me"
* Why do people hate change? Because then change results in having to relearn something. That is uncomfortable, and there is doubt whether or not they can personally learn it.

## Chapter 35
* The key to failures and experience to be able to utilize it in the future. Otherwise, it's a waste of time. 

## Chapter 36
* Community is good.
* Community in the work place promotes happiness.

## Chapter 37
* Use pilot projects to disturb and bring back excitement to an org. Pilot projects allow for something new to be tried out and are cheaper than full-on projects. But don't try too many things at once. 
* "War games" - allow for internal competition without the fear of any losses
* Brainstorming
* Training, trips, conferences, celebrations - Good for morale

## Chapter 38
* Positions exist which are allowed to have their role defined: Fellows
* Some people need a charter defined, but some people want to define the charter.

## Chapter 39
* "Sociology matters more than technology".
