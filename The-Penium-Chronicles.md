## Chapter 1
* **P6 Project** - Pentium Pro, which eventually became Pentium II, Pentium III, and then forked to become Centrino, Xeon, and Core processors.
* Initial challenge in 1990 was to create a CPU that was 2x as fast as the P5 (Pentium)
* CPU architectures get performance improvement for free when simply having a better process (smaller transistors, etc)
* Most improvement though, come from how a team designs to utilize the transistors. 
* **Proliferation Thinking** - First generation of some product is most likely going to not be economical. Lots of research and development costs, and things are a bit inefficient.
  * It is the 2nd, 3rd, and subsequent generations where the design matures and starts to bring ROI. 
* Big ideas - Come from brain storm, then best idea is picked through refinement.
* **4 project phases** - Concept, Refinement, Realization, Production
  * Each project phase overlaps.
  * Concept - brainstorming. Anything goes
  * Refinement - best ideas from concept stage are chosen
  * Realization - develop the idea
  * Production - driving what you've created and seeing it produced at high volume.
* Do whatever it takes to see things through.
