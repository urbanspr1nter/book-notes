## Joel on Software

_2023-04-23_

This is my brief review of **Joel on Software**. Most of the articles were written between years 2000 and 2004 in the book. Since I am reading in 2023, it's best to go into this book with an open mind. Even doing so, what was really impressive to me was that Joel was pretty spot-on on some of the ideas even to this day. It's aged well.

The book is more about software management and the business of the industry as opposed to being super technical.

Some of my favorite discussions:

- performance - your code may seem performant, but the underlying library may not.
- leaky abstraction - sometimes you may have to try to understand what the abstraction is abstracting to be productive.
- Ben & Jerry's vs Amazon type companies. You can only choose one, it is stupid to try and have it all.
- Microsoft's dual existence of "Raymond Chen" camp and MSDN Subscription camp (backwards compatibility vs hot new shiny thing)
- Are PMs useless? LOL no. Try dealing with people day-to-day. You will appreciate a good PM. Knowing coding should be the last thing they care about...
- Knowing cultural differences between Windows and Linux. Ex. Windows targets for the best user experience (ease of use) as opposed to technical excellence in code. Linux prefers really good technical architecture)
- Is it worth delaying your product 18 months to try and get your program to comply with some technical limitation which may not be one in the near future? (Lotus 123 debacle)
- Economies of scale (McDonald's vs. Naked Chef discussion)

The read is very easy overall, and I really recommend it.
