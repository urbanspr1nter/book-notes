# Explain the Cloud Like I'm 10

by Todd Hoff

* The **cloud** is a term that refers to computers in a data center over the internet.
* Origin is that we draw network diagrams and use a cloud icon to represent the internet.
* Cloud computing is the interest in studying what happens in this "cloud icon".
* Nothing magical. Everything happens in a data center with a bunch of cabinets containing servers that look like pizza-boxes. Although this varies from company to company.
* Cloud provider vs cloud service. Cloud service is an application that runs on the cloud that you can use to help get things done. Ex. Dropbox, OneDrive, Gmail, Facebook Messenger, Twitter, etc. Cloud provider allows you to rent computing in a data center. A cloud provider can also provide services which you can use to develop your own products such as a web, database, mail or messaging queueing service.
* Facebook Messenger is a cloud service. When you send a message using Facebook Messenger, the message is sent to a server in Facebook's data center. This message is then sent the person who it is intended for.
* Facebook has its own private cloud, hosting its services in its own data center. Facebook doesn't use a cloud provider. They are their own cloud provider. It makes more economical sense that way.
* Netflix is a contradiction, they use AWS, but they are more focused in building out and providing the cloud service rather than focusing too much developing the infrastructure. (Note this may be changing)
* Either above approach works. It depends on the company.
* Desktop application vs cloud application. Desktop application, boxed software, etc. data is stored locally on the computer. Sometimes only a single user can access at at ime. Cloud application, usually use a web browser. Data is stored remotely. Many users (as long as license permits) can access the application at the same time. 
* Internet is a series of interconnected networks. The networks individually, are connected by cables. Even using undersea cables.
* Cloud computing has gotten so popular that even AWS makes more money for Amazon than their online retail site.
